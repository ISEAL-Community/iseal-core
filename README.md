# ISEAL Core Metadata Set
The ISEAL Core Metadata Set (ISEAL Core) is a set of structured terms and vocabularies that can be used as metadata to describe, share, and reuse different digital resources across the [ISEAL Community](https://www.isealalliance.org/) and broader set of stakeholders. The resources described using the ISEAL Core are those that sustainability systems typically collect, curate, manage, use, publish and archive. They may be datasets, published research, certificates, videos, images, maps, or other organizational documentation.
